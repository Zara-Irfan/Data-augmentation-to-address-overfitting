#Data Augmentation to Address Overfitting
Overview

This project demonstrates the use of data augmentation techniques to reduce overfitting in machine learning models, particularly in image classification tasks. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Data augmentation helps improve model generalization by artificially increasing the diversity of the training dataset.

Key Concepts

Overfitting: When a model memorizes training data instead of learning general patterns.

Data Augmentation: Techniques used to create new training examples from existing data, including transformations such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and shifting.

Generalization: The ability of a model to perform well on new, unseen data.

Purpose

The goal of this project is to show how applying data augmentation can:

Increase the effective size of the dataset.

Introduce variability to training images.

Help models generalize better to unseen data.

Learning Outcomes

By following this project, you will learn:

What overfitting is and how it impacts model performance.

How data augmentation can mitigate overfitting.

The types of augmentation commonly used in image datasets.

The importance of preprocessing and normalizing images for training.
